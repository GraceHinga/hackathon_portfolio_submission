## ⚠️ Important Notes

- 🔗 **Broken Links**: Project demo and GitHub links are placeholders — update these with actual URLs.
- 📄 **Resume File**: The current path (`C:\Users\Administrator\...`) is local-only. Replace with a relative path like:

  ```html
  href="assets/documents/Njambi_Hinga_CV.pdf"
  ```

- 📧 **Form Handling**: The contact form currently has no back-end logic. To make it functional, connect it to a server or use a service like **Formspree**, **Netlify Forms**, or **Google Forms**.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add JavaScript for form validation and interactivity
- Make the site fully responsive using media queries
- Host projects on GitHub Pages or Vercel and link them
- Add real backend integration for contact form and resume hosting
- Incorporate animations or transitions for UX enhancement
